safety: lane change path should optimize the distance away from other traffic
comfort: low acceleration and jerk
    => linear equation for s and d to calculate acceleration and jerk, see Quintic Polynomial Solver
        and Polynomial Trajectory

predict where the other cars will be in the future: s_future = s_current + v * T, where v is transformed to (s,d) coordinates


lane_shift: if in left most lane || there is car within 30m ahead || there is car within 50m behind, do no shift left
